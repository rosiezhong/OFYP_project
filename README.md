# OFYP-Analyse presence and proportion of gene flow between UK insects
## split.sh
Translocation, differences in genome positions etc. can decrease mapping coverage. Hence, the chromosomal copy of the second species is split before aligning it with the reference genome(chromosomal copy of species 1). Split.sh can be run as follows
```
./split.sh species_prefix
```
Ensure relevant raw genome data files are in the same folder
